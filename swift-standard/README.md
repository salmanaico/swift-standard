## What is this?

This is a **Swift/Xcode** application, with basic unit tests, for which coverage is uploaded to Codecov on a daily basis. It can also serve as an example for how to integrate Codecov into your Swift/Xcode project. If the build is passing for this project, then Codecov's Swift/Xcode report processing is functional and correct on codecov.io.

## Configuration

This application is built in `Xcode 11` and uses `Swift 5`. The UI for this application is built atop `SwiftUI`. This project includes both unit and ui tests, written with the `XCTest` framework. These tests are simulated on an `iPhone Xʀ` running `iOS 13`. Coverage reports are generated via [Slather](https://github.com/SlatherOrg/slather).

Unit tests: `/standard-swiftTests/Test_Index.swift`

UI tests:
`/standard-swiftUITests/Test_Index_UI.swift`

Slather configuration (.slather.yml):
```yaml
coverage_service: cobertura_xml
xcodeproj: ./standard-swift.xcodeproj
scheme: standard-swift
output_directory: ./
```
Travis configuration (.travis.yml):
```yaml
install:
  - gem install slather
script:
  - xcodebuild -scheme standard-swift -sdk iphonesimulator -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone Xʀ,OS=13.0' build test
  - slather 
  - bash <(curl -s https://codecov.io/bash) -f ./cobertura.xml
```

## Processing Coverage Reports

By default, coverage reports are not generated for Xcode builds. To make sure your Xcode scheme generates coverage reports click on your scheme --> "Edit Scheme" --> "Test" --> check "Gather coverage." Now, coverage reports will automatically be generated for each build.

## Errors Processing `.xccoverage` Files

Xcode generates special `.xccoverage` files which hold coverage information for each build. These files are **not** human readable and Codecov may run into errors while parsing these files. To get the relevant information out of these files after your build, it is recommended you use a tool like [Slather](https://github.com/SlatherOrg/slather) to generate a `coverage.xml` file that can then be uploaded to Codecov.

## Coverage Inflation

All Xcode projects include separate folders for unit tests and ui tests. In some instances, the files in these folders may arbitrarily inflate the overall coverage percentage reported by Codecov because they are automatically lumped together as a part of the coverage report. If you don't want to include these files, we recommend you use Slather as a part of your workflow to generate coverage reports as it will discard unit/ui test folders from your coverage report. Otherwise, you can choose to exclude these folders via your `.codecov.yml` through [ignore paths](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/ignoring-paths).

## Reporting Issues

If you've discovered an issue with this repository or with Swift processing in general, it is recommended to email support@codecov.io rather than post an issue here. This repository will not be checked regularly for open issues.
